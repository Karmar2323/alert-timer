# Time Alerter (alert timer)
The goal is to set an alert that shows on SteelSeries device LED or on PC screen or plays a sound.
 
## Work in progress
The development begun with the buttons on the windowed application that start and stop the timer. The time remaining is also shown. Setting of the alert time will eventually be possible. Different alert execution types are under consideration: a sound, [SteelSeries device LED]https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk) or other notification.
